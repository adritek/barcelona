# Meeting's Objectives

Conclude de Barcelona codebar missions workshop by uniting the works of the 2 groups

# Presents

* Amalia (@amaliacardenas)
* Lori (@loriking)
* Martin (@jmbriano)
* David (@daverick )

# 1st Part

The group formed by Lori, Martin and David rebuild the codebar mission from the intermediary outputs of the workshops.

> Our goal is to enable underrepresented people to learn programming in a safe and collaborative environment and expand their career opportunities. To achieve this we run free regular workshops, regular one-off events and try to create opportunities for our students making technology and coding more accessible.

Some precisions might be needed to what `underrepresented people` exactly means. Our main public is currently women with some LGBTIQ. We would like to help immigrants too but we don't reach them with our current communication channels and we are not sure to be able to make a safe environment for everyone everybody together at the same place.

Our main tool are the regular free programming workshop.

Amalia presented the work of the second group. Due to miscommunication not detected by David, this group worked on how to address the mains pains and benefits of our users  [here](../2018-11-03@openbravo/Work on codebar Mission by group Amalia, Irina & Cvetan.md)

# 2nd part

We all agree on the Barcelona codebar mission statement.
ðŸ¦„ðŸŽŠðŸŽ‰ðŸŒˆ
And now that we are aligned on our objectives and means, we felt ready to go forward!

We start talking about how we could move forward and evolve our governance to make it easier. David recall the conversation we had with Ignasi from the Barcelona Python Group after a codebar workshop where he explain how the boards follows and valids the initiatives from some members of the community with the restriction that at lest one member of the board is present in each group.

We elaborate the proposition in the next paragraph.
David is in charge of explaining them to the organizers that were not present at the meeting.

# Propositions

With the objectives to allow different initiatives and always keep the Barcelona codebar mission as our main goal and mean, we propose:
* now that the mission is clear we trust a priori that everybody is inspired by it.
* initiatives can be lead by a restrict number of the organizers (and some codebar users)
* once a month we will meet physically and/or online:
  * to evaluate how the on-going initiatives are going ( classic standup meeting format, what has been done, what will be done and the blocking point still present )
  * to study new initiatives presented by one of the organizer. Unless one organizer veto the initiative because it is not aligned with the Barcelona codebar mission, the initiative can go forward and will be evaluated at each meeting.
  * these meeting to be efficient should be facilitated by one organizer and short in time (1 hour). The facilitator has the obligation to write down the minutes of the meeting for ~~prosperity~~ the organizers that couldn't be present to the meeting.
* In a few month we will evaluate if this works and make correction to this new governance if needed.
