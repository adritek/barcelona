# Workshop

We split into two teams (Lori, Martin , David) and (Amalia, Irina, Cvetan) in order to find out what actions we could do, following the formula:
`We plan to achieve X by doing Y.` (where X are the most voted items from the Workshop-minutes, in every category)

#### Coaches:
  1. Recognition
    - Badges
    - Tell coaches so they know they're directly helping students to get a job.(i.e. working with person that's actively trying to learn to code may improve coaches engagement)
    - Short presentation of our coaches in our *blog* - e.g. _meet Javi_
    - Public recognition of how much they have contributed - i.e *live link* with how many events they have attended /
    - github style of contributions / heatmap. So the coaches can brag about it - e.g. I have been a coach 35 times in codebar.

  2. Networking
    - Networking day just for coaches ?
    - Recommending students to the coach's company to get bonus ?

  3. Free food
    - Require from all hosts snacks (not only chips) or have a backup budget to cover it on our own if needed. (e.g. if host XYZ is not proving anything but chips we may ask them for permission to bring our food)

    - If employees of company X want to train to learn how to code, just come as a students, if something else - provide by networking with other meetups.
