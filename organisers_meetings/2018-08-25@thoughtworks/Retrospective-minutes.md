# Conclusions
After the 😁😑😩 parts and the 🗳parts, 2 points have been addressed:
* _Too much work and stress_ from the 😑 section: The following actions will be taken:
    * Keep Trello and how things are assigned today
    * Automate the process of organizing the meet ups
* _Lack of process lead to misunderstanding_ from the 😩 section. A long discussion started about the process, agile, changes, mission, governance … and almost everything on the board!

* It has been decided that before starting with the process a dedicated meeting to define the mission of the codebar BCN will be realized.
        * A discussion started about how to realize this meeting and the following has been agreed:
        * the objective of the meeting is to write down the mission of codebar BCN
        * David will be your facilitator for this meeting and David has a little forced the following: it will be a brainstorming/collobarative workshop to determine the mission form the group, not a work in finding the common denominator from each one vision of the BCN codebar mission. The only preliminary work needed from you is to be prepared to explain your motivations to the others « Why are you a organizer of codebar BCN? ». The collaborative workshop will be guided by the ‘users' of codebar BCN. I will later one send you agenda of the meeting how I see it.
