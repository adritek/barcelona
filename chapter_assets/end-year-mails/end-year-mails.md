Hi [CONTACT NAME],

We are reaching the end of the year, and we wanted to thank you once again for contributing to codebar.
We would not be able to host any workshop if it was not for spaces like yours, always open to contribute with us.

[SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH]

2018 has been great for us, and part of it was because of you. So we wish 2019 allows us to keep collaborating together!
