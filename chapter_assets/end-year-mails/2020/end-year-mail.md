Subject: Updating contact details and Codebar Festival

Hi [CONTACT NAME],

It has been a while since we were in contact and we hope that 2021 is going well for you. We are updating our host contact list and wanted to check that we have your correct contact details. Do you have a functional email that we could use to contact you, or should we use the contact details below?

[insert contact details]


We also wanted to let you know that we are back to hosting regular bi-weekly coding workshops. All of our events are virtual at the moment, and we have also added one off talks and events that are open to everyone within the global codebar community. If you are interested in collaborating with us on a one off talk let us know.


 We wanted to invite you to the codebar festival happening March 12-14. It is a free three day virtual event full of talks, panel discussions and workshops on coding, career and wellness. Each day will have a different focus and the lineup looks very interesting. 

 [Day 1: Focus on Coding](https://codebar.io/events/codebar-festival-2021-day-1)

 [Day 2: Focus on Career](https://codebar.io/events/codebar-festival-2021-day-2)

 [Day 3: Focus on Wellbeing](https://codebar.io/events/codebar-festival-2021-day-3)

Feel free to share the event with your community.

 It will be some time before we can return to in person workshops, but in the mean time we look forward to keeping in touch. Let us know if there is anything that we can do to help you during this time.

 Kind regards,
