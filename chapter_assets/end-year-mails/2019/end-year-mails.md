Subject: A big thank you from codebar Barcelona

Hi [CONTACT NAME],

We are reaching the end of the year, and we wanted to thank you once again for contributing to codebar.
We would not be able to host any workshop if it was not for spaces like yours, always open to contribute with us.

[SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH]

2019 has been great for us, and part of it was because of you. So we wish 2020 allows us to keep collaborating together!

Please extend our gratitude to everyone that helped you making this happen at your space!

|Thoughtworks Barcelona|7|During 2019 we doubled the number of workshops at Thoughtworks. You keep being a very special location for codebar in Barcelona. Sharing our mission with you made each of the 7 sessions we had this year a pleasure for everyone. Seeing so many ThoughtWorkers participating in a diversity initiative is encouraging and we could not be more thankful for that. Additionally we'd like to thank you for allowing us to record one of the workshops with the Elastic team|[photo](tws.jpg)|NO|
|Softonic|2|During 2019 we doubled the number of workshops at Softonic from 2018. It is truly special when our coaches and students also become hosts. For us this shows the strength of all the members in our community and how together we can help make tech more diverse.|[photo](softonic.jpg)|NO|
|Qlik|3|Qlik keeps being a great partner. The three events you hosted this year were great fun. The effort and detail you put into organising each event has helped us create a welcoming space for the codebar community to learn, have fun, and connect with one another. The Halloween decorations were superb. We loved it!|[photo](qlik.jpg)|NO|
|TravelPerk|1|We are happy we could do a session with you this year. We know moving office space has been challenging and we are eager to get to see your new space and show it to the whole codebar community.|[photo](travelperk.jpg)|NO|
|Ubiqum|2|What an year for Ubiqum! We feel so happy for having your support in 2 workshops during 2019 even with all the changes you went though this year. Thank you a lot for supporting this initiative.|[photo](ubiqum.jpg)|NO|
|DepotLab|2|We know recently we have not reach you out despite how welcomed we felt every time you hosted us. codebar has grown a lot this year and we need to prioritise host having bigger spaces. But be sure we'll reach you out soon again. We are designing new types of sessions for smaller groups, where we are sure DepotLab will be an amazing place to host them.|[photo](depotlab.jpg)|NO|
|Typeform|1|We are incredibly happy to be in contact with Typeform again. We had a lovely time back then in the Beach House and your space in Bac de Roda is amazing. Thank you once again for helping to diversify the tech community in Barcelona more and more.|[photo](typeform.jpg)|NO|
|Lemonade|1|We know recently we have not reach out to you despite how welcomed we felt every time you hosted us. codebar has grown a lot this year and we need to prioritise host having bigger spaces. We are still very grateful for allowing us to have some of the the organisers meetings in your space. But be sure we'll reach you out soon again for smaller events. We are designing new types of sessions for smaller groups, where we are sure Lemonade will be an amazing place to host them.|[photo](lemonade.jpg)|NO|
|King Barcelona|1|We did not have the chance this year to organise many workshops in your space, but still we want to thank you a lot for opening your doors to codebar and for the warm welcome we always have there. The whimsical and playfulness at King has made all of the codebar events truly enjoyable.|[photo](king.jpg)|YES|
