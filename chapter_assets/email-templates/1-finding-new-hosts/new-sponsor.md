## New Sponsor Information
Hi XXX,

I'm writing you to give you more detailed information about codebar.io and provide you with details for hosting a workshop.

**About codebar**

Codebar.io is a non-profit initiative that facilitates the growth of a diverse tech community by running regular programming workshops. The organization started in 2016 in the UK and has expanded all over the world since. We have chapters from the US to Australia passing throughout Europe, Ghana and China!


We do this by pairing students with volunteer coaches who work at different companies throughout Barcelona. We started a chapter in Barcelona in 2017, and host workshops every two weeks.

Some of our students want to become full-time developers, and others are interested in learning the basics in a welcoming environment. Our community is expanding and we are looking for more companies to host us.

**How to host a workshop**

If you are interested in hosting a workshop, this is what we would need. A space that can host a minimum of 35 people. Some tables to work at, WIFI, power outlets, or extension cables to plug in laptops, and since people are coming to the workshops after work we encourage hosts to provide food and drinks. We ask that vegetarian and vegan options be available as well.    

The number of people that we open up the workshop to is **35 people and the workshop runs from 18:30-20:45**.
