## Do I need a computer?

Hi XXX,

Yes, it would be helpful if you could bring your laptop. This way you can continue to work on the material you cover during the workshop. Other than your laptop, you don't need to bring anything else. If you do not have a laptop, let us know and we will provide one for your to use during the workshop.

If you have any questions before or after the workshop, be sure to join our slack channel:
https://slack.codebar.io/

Make sure you join the following two channels.  The helpdesk channel is where you can ask any coding related questions.

`#barcelona-chapter`

`#helpdesk`

We are looking forward to meeting you at the workshop! Welcome to the codebar community :)

Best,
XXX
