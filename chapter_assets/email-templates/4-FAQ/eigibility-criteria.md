## Eligibility Criteria
Hi XXX,

Codebar was started out of recognition that there is a shortage of women, LGBTQ, and people belonging to underrepresented ethnic groups in tech.

If you belong to one of these groups, you are more than welcome to attend. If not, there are some other great initiatives where you can learn in a collaborative environment:

- **Free Code Camp Barcelona** https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.barcelona/  - Software Crafters Barcelona https://www.meetup.com/Software-Crafters-Barcelona/
- **Barcelona Python Meetup** https://www.meetup.com/python-185/
- **Swift Peer Labs** https://www.meetup.com/ThoughtWorks-Barcelona/

Our coaches, organizers and sponsors donate their time and money to help those who have faced unfair barriers to entry into the tech world. We have strived to create an inclusive, welcoming community, and so far, we have not had to implement a formal policy to enforce the eligibility criteria -- we have left this to the honesty and good faith of the students.

If you are unsure whether you are eligible, you can read more about our eligibility criteria here https://codebar.io/student-guide#eligibility.

Thank you very much for your understanding.

Best,

XXX
