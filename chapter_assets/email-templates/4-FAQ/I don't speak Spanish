Hi, XXX

In our workshops the main language is English. Once the student is working with a coach they might switch to any language that is better to them. on your own, if that is an option that might appeal to you.

So you are welcome to the Barcelona chapter even if you don't speak Spanish or Catalan!

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Best,

XXX
