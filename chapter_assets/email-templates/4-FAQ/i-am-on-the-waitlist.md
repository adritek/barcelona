## I am on the waitlist, can I attend?
Hi XXX,

Thank you for your email. Our events have been getting quite popular, and we might not be able to accommodate all students. We do announce the events early in our slack channel. Make sure that join the slack channel and sign up right when the invitation comes out to ensure you book a spot.

If you can't attend this event, there are also virtual codebar sessions held on Sundays that you can sign up for. Here is the link https://codebar.io/events/virtual.

We look forward to seeing you at a future event.

Best,

XXX
