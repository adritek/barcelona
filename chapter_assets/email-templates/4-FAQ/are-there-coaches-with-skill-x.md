## Are there coaches with skill X? 

Hi, XXX

In our workshops, it is not always possible to guarantee that coaches with given skills will be available, and it will be different from workshop to workshop depending on the attendance of the coaches. This is why we recommend you to think about a backup topic in a different technology just in case, to increase your chances to get a coach.

Sometimes we have some experienced coaches that despite not having the expertise in a particular technology, could still help you to find answers on your own, if that is an option that might appeal to you.

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Best,

XXX
