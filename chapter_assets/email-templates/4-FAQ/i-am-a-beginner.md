## I don't have programming skills, can I still attend?

Hi XXX,

It's no problem if you do not have any coding skills, the workshop is very welcoming to beginners, and I am sure that it will be very helpful for you. Before the workshop, it might be helpful if you reviewed some of the tutorials that we have on our website so that you can get specific help on something that you are stuck with. Here is a link to the tutorials. Don't worry about not being very advanced, we are all here to help you improve and with some practice you will be surprised by how much you learn.

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Best,

XXX
