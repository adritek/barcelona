## New Sponsor Information
Hi XXX,

I'm writing you to give you more detailed information about codebar.io and provide you with details for hosting a workshop.

**About codebar**

Codebar.io is an organization that started in the UK. The aim is to help women and other underrepresented groups in tech learn to program.

We do this by pairing students with volunteer developers who work at different companies throughout Barcelona. We started a chapter in Barcelona over two years ago, and host workshops every two weeks. https://www.meetup.com/Codebar-Barcelona/

Some of our students want to become full-time developers, and others are interested in learning the basics in a welcoming environment. Our community is expanding and we are looking for more companies to host us.

**How to host a workshop**

If you are interested in hosting a workshop, this is what we would need. A space that can host a minimum of 35 people. Some tables to work at, an internet connection, power outlets, or extension cables to plug in laptops, and since people are coming to the workshops after work we encourage hosts to provide food and drinks. We ask that vegan options be available as well.    

The number of people that we open up the workshop to is **35 people and the workshop runs from 18:30-20:45**.



**Typical Agenda for the event**

- 18:00- 18:30 A member of the codebar team will arrive on the day of the event at 18h to help set up.

- 18:30- 18:45 Participants arrive and network over drinks and food

- 18:45- 19:00 Round of Presentations

- 19:00- 19:10 Pairing of coaches and students

- 19:10- 20:45 Coding

## Do I need a computer?

Hi XXX,

Yes, it would be helpful if you could bring your laptop. This way you can continue to work on the material you cover during the workshop. Other than your laptop, you don't need to bring anything else. If you do not have a laptop, let us know and we will provide one for your to use during the workshop.

If you have any questions before or after the workshop, be sure to join our slack channel:
https://slack.codebar.io/

Make sure you join the following two channels.  The helpdesk channel is where you can ask any coding related questions.

`#barcelona-chapter`

`#helpdesk`

We are looking forward to meeting you at the workshop! Welcome to the codebar community :)

## I don't have programming skills, can I still attend?

Hi XXX,

It's no problem if you do not have any coding skills, the workshop is very welcoming to beginners, and I am sure that it will be very helpful for you. Before the workshop, it might be helpful if you reviewed some of the tutorials that we have on our website so that you can get specific help on something that you are stuck with. Here is a link to the tutorials. Don't worry about not being very advanced, we are all here to help you improve and with some practice you will be surprised by how much you learn.

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

## Eligibility Criteria
Hi XXX,

Codebar was started out of recognition that there is a shortage of women, LGBTQ, and people belonging to underrepresented ethnic groups in tech.

If you belong to one of these groups, you are more than welcome to attend. If not, there are some other great initiatives where you can learn in a collaborative environment:

- **Free Code Camp Barcelona** https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.barcelona/  - Software Crafters Barcelona https://www.meetup.com/Software-Crafters-Barcelona/
- **Barcelona Python Meetup** https://www.meetup.com/python-185/
- **Swift Peer Labs** https://www.meetup.com/ThoughtWorks-Barcelona/

Our coaches, organizers and sponsors donate their time and money to help those who have faced unfair barriers to entry into the tech world. We have strived to create an inclusive, welcoming community, and so far, we have not had to implement a formal policy to enforce the eligibility criteria -- we have left this to the honesty and good faith of the students.

If you are unsure whether you are eligible, you can read more about our eligibility criteria here https://codebar.io/student-guide#eligibility.

Thank you very much for your understanding.

Best,

XXX

## I am on the waitlist, can I attend?
Hi XXX,

Thank you for your email. Our events have been getting quite popular, and we might not be able to accommodate all students. We do announce the events early in our slack channel. Make sure that join the slack channel and sign up right when the invitation comes out to ensure you book a spot.
https://slack.codebar.io/  #baracelona-chapter.

If you can't attend this event, there are also virtual codebar sessions held on Sundays that you can sign up for. Here is the link https://codebar.io/events/virtual.

We look forward to seeing you at a future event.

Best,

XXX  


## I can no longer attend

Hi XXX,

Thank you for letting us know. We will update your status in the system. Good luck with everything, and we will see you at another workshop in the future.

Best,

XXX

## Multiple no shows

Hi XXX,

How are you? This is (YOUR NAME) from codebar.

I'm writing you since we are reviewing the list of participants for tomorrow to check the number of students and coaches.

As there is a waiting list, we are double checking those students that have a high rate of no-shows after a positive RSVP.

May I kindly ask you to update you attendance if you know already that you are not coming? This will allow one of the students on the waitlist to participate.

As a general recommendation please keep your RSVP updated. If this trend of having waitlist continues we will need to start prioritizing people with less no-shows. You already have a total of XXX.

Thanks a lot for understanding.

Best,

XXX
