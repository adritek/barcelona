## Multiple no shows

Hi XXX,

How are you? This is (YOUR NAME) from codebar.

I'm writing you since we are reviewing the list of participants for tomorrow to check the number of students and coaches.

As there is a waiting list, we are double checking those students that have a high rate of no-shows after a positive RSVP.

May I kindly ask you to update you attendance if you know already that you are not coming? This will allow one of the students on the waitlist to participate.

As a general recommendation please keep your RSVP updated. If this trend of having waitlist continues we will need to start prioritizing people with less no-shows. You already have a total of XXX.

Thanks a lot for understanding.

Best,

XXX
