Hey XXXX,

I’m one of the organisers of the Codebar Barcelona chapter, and I’m getting in touch with you, to give a friendly reminder about the code of conduct (https://codebar.io/code-of-conduct), since agreeing to it, is a requisite to join Codebar. The reason I’m doing so, is because it has come to our attention what happened in our last workshop (May 6th), a situation that did lead to one of the other participants to get uncomfortable.

If for any reason, during a workshop you don’t want to be paired with someone, that is OK, you can let the organisers know in private, and we will do our best to re-arrange the pairs whenever possible. It is important for us to maintain a safe space for everyone, including you of course.

While it is true that in the code of conduct the focus is on strong words, such as harassment, to maintain the safe space for everyone, we expect that everyone respects each other, and addressing another participant using qualifiers, judgements or dismissing their contributions, even if it is with polite words, is considered as a micro-aggression, and it can compromise the space safety, and that is not acceptable for us.
Let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks
