I have just seen your announce in #barcelona-chapter. How does this event
promote diversity in tech in Barcelona?
If it doesn’t, please take it out from this channel.
You are welcome to publish it in #barcelona-social.
If you have any questions or comments do not hesitate to get in touch with me

# More formal message strips if the first one is not sufficent


The rule is clear, if the event promotes diversity in tech, it can be in
the #barcelona-chapter. if not he might be welcome in #barcelona-social
I had a look at your meetup. I didn’t see any talk related to diversity,
and I haven’t see a code of conduct that assure it to be a safe place.


Regarding the code of conduct, it is one of the best way to feel people safe.
imo the CNCF one is really great (https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
but there are sipmler one likes codebar’s one (https://codebar.io/code-of-conduct)

The #barcelona-chapter channel is only for announcing codebar events or other
events in Barcelona that promotes diversity in Tech. This is not a public place
where anybody can announce anything. We actively take care of it by checking the
content, the diversity of the speakers, the existence of a code of conduct and
if it is free or diversity tickets exist.  In the past we have asked announcers
to take down their message or taken them down ourself when needed and will
continue to do so.
We do not believe that diversity can be achieved by just saying ‘everybody is
welcome’. It need to be unambiguously encouraged and members of underrepresented
group need to fell safe and protected. That is the first role of the code of
conduct. The second one is to announce to all the (other) assistants that  
diversity is encouraged ( and protected). We are open to talk about it in detail
if you want to know more about diversity and how we see it and promote it. All
codebar activities are made under codebar’s code of conduct. Maybe we aren’t
clear enough with the host about that fact.


I hope to hear from you soon and we wish to continue to work with you to promote
 diversity in Tech.
Regards,
David
