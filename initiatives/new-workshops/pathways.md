# Workshops and learning paths.

## Motivation
This is the follow-up from the last organisers meeting.  It addresses ways we can increase learning opportunities for
codebar attendees (coaches and students) by providing specialised workshops and learning paths.

## Events and Activities

1. Git/GitHub (workshop)
2. Pair programming (workshop)
3. Introduction to docker (workshop)
4. Introduction to Jupyter Notebook/Jupyter Labs (workshop)
5. Study groups that cumulate in a group project.
  * Self-managed study groups of 4 - 8 (ideal size 6) people
  * One dedicated coach and/or BA that can help the group plan goals and provide structure (rituals)
  * All groups begin with training on git/GitHub and pair programming.
  * Curriculum or study guide developed and provided (can even be that everyone is following the same online class)
  * After reaching a certain milestone, the group can move on to working on a project.
  * Monthly Showcase: students presentations updating projects.
6. Working in tech: a presentation on the different kinds of tech jobs (panel discussion)
Since working in tech is much more than knowing how to write a few lines of code, we are proposing a session that would give an overview of different kinds of jobs in the industry (BA, PM, PO, Scrum master, etc.) as well as different kinds of developer jobs (generalists vs specialists).

8. Good to have:
  * Identify jobs and companies that are open to beginners.


## Possible project ideas

1. Contribute to a beginner friendly open source projects such as one of [these](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2019-05-08-code-with-these-oss-projects) or this one in [Python/Django](https://github.com/oppia/oppia) or this one in [Python](https://github.com/coala/coala)
2. Create a project in the language they have been working on: “codetwitterbar”
3. [Codebar pairing support tool](https://github.com/codebar/barcelona/tree/pairing-support-tool/tools/pairing-support-tool)
