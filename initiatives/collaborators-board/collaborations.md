# Collaborators board

## Objective
The codebar.io community is growing, and members also wish to contribute to this project. For this reason, we would like to start sharing some of the organiser's activities with the growing community.

So, when you are ready to take you collaboration to the next level, we have a bunch of tasks that you can help us with. **Ready?**

## How to contribute
Start by reading the options below, we separated them into tasks to be completed **During the workshops** and in **Between workshops**. If you want to perform any of them, let us know on Slack. The text below are just short descriptions. In case you are interested in trying any of them, we'll explain them in more details. Taking one of this tasks does not mean you'll do it for life. You can take any of them only once, or regularly. It's up to your availability.

## During the workshops
### Preparing the space
This task consists in arriving a bit earlier than the _workshop_ start time to **help the company hosting us** prepare the space. Set up tables and electricity extenders, spread the food and drinks, set up the reception desk, and sometimes receive some early comers. The hosts, specially the new ones, are intrigued by the way everything will work and they want to give the best of themselves. This task allows us to get to know our hosts, and give back by helping out.

### Door person
This task consists in **receiving the participants** when they arrive and checking students and coaches in using the codebar platform. It also consists of giving each person a name tag and briefly introducing them to the space (where the food, bathrooms, etc are). For new comers, this person can put her/him in contact with someone helping in the integration (see the next activity for details).

### Integrating new-comers
This task is very important and can be a _life changer_ in the experience the participants will have of codebar. It consists in keeping an eye on the people coming to codebar for the first time. **There are quite _outgoing_ people that will not need help integrating with others**, but there are also more _introverted_ people that will need some extra help. People taking this task should moving around the space to make sure that no-one left alone. After a short talk try putting newcomers in contact with some other regulars. Asking what they want to learn/coach can help put them in contact with students/coaches sharing that interest.

### Introducing codebar - MC
We normally call this role the MC (Master of Ceremony). This person is the one that **starts the workshops** by setting up a circle, explains what we'll do and presents the main rules. They also thank everyone for collaborating. More details on what should be said during the presentation can be found [here](../../workshops-preparation/script-presentation.md).

### Pairing support
Pairing has improved a lot with the introduction of an online tool built for this task. Nevertheless, using this tool still requires some manual work **to find the best Student-Coach pairs**. A good pairing makes codebar experience memorable for both students and coaches.

Sometimes, pairing is not an easy task and it has to be performed quite quickly (we only have the time while everyone is doing the presentations to come up with a list of pairs). This task also has a research component. The person performing this tasks should ask the students **what they want to learn** and the coaches **what they can teach**. This is normally performed in the first segment while people are eating /drinking.

## Between workshops
### In Slack
Slack is part of building the community. There are two channels specific to Barcelona: #barcelona-chapter and #barcelona-social. This task consists in **participating and moderating** these channels based on the mission of codebar.io. It also consists in reminding people of upcoming sessions, our social media, etc regularly.

### In our social media
We have [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/codebar-Barcelona/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/codebarbcn/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codebarbcn) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/codebarBCN) accounts. This task consists in helping create content in one (or as many as you want) platforms. They are currently only used for promoting the workshops, but nothing forbids us from **publishing more content related to the codebar mission**.

### Looking for new hosts
The more we grow, the more we need hosts that have large spaces to accommodate the workshops. This tasks consists in helping **find new companies that can host us**. Normally, codebar members refer us to the companies they work at. After that, this task consists in reaching out to new hosts, explaining what codebar is, if possible visiting them to confirm that the space is adequate, and following up with the contact person for the preparation of the workshop. Hosts normally have questions and a contact person from the codebar organization is always part of the nice ramp up process for them.
[This article](../../host-selection/host-prioritization.md) defines the **must** and **nice to have** for new hosts and additional information about this task.

### Contributing to our on-going initiatives
We keep all our initiatives public in Github so anyone can comment on them. The more diverse the people that reviews them is, the better they will result. So don't be afraid to **check the [open initiatives board](https://github.com/codebar/barcelona/projects/2) and leave you comments** on any of them.

Below is a few of them where more active participation is welcome:
#### Pairing support tool
This tasks consists in building a **new tool to help in the pairing process**. More info: [here](../../../tools/pairing-support-tool/README.md)

#### One-off workshops
Consists in giving **topic-specific talks in between workshops**. These talks will have a different format and will be given on specific days. Probably once a month. If you have a talk that you would like to present get in touch with us. More info: [here](https://github.com/codebar/barcelona/projects/1)
