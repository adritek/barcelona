### Workshops and learning paths.

As a part of our ongoing discussions on ways we can provide more to attendees of codebar we are proposing this initiative to increase learning opportunities for attendees.


1. Git/GitHub (workshop)
2. Pair programming (workshop)
3. Different kinds of tech jobs (panel discussion)
4. Group projects
5. Good to have:
  * Identify jobs and companies that are open to beginners.

_Panel discussion: Different kinds of tech jobs_

What does it mean to work in tech?

Since working in tech is much more than knowing how to write a few lines of code, we are proposing a session that would give an overview of different kinds of jobs in the industry (BA, PM, PO, Scrum master, etc.) as well as different kinds of developer jobs (generalists vs specialists).


_Projects_


1. Self-managed study groups
  * Self-managed study groups of 4 - 8 (ideal size 6) people
  * One dedicated coach and/or BA that can help the group plan goals and provide structure (rituals)
  * All groups begin with training on git/GitHub and pair programming.
  * Curriculum or study guide developed and provided (can even be that everyone is following the same online class)
  * After reaching a certain milestone, the group can move on to working on a project
2. Contribute to an open source project
3. Create a project in the language they have been working on: “codetwitterbar”
4.  [Codebar pairing support tool](https://github.com/codebar/barcelona/tree/pairing-support-tool/tools/pairing-support-tool)

*Showcase*

* Each group will demonstrate their progress (monthly?)
