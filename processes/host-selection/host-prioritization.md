# Meeting to decide host prioritization

**DATE:** 2019-23-01

**PARTICIPANTS:** @Jethet, @eskape16, @daverick, @amaliacardenas
**LOCATION:** Cloud Co-working

## TL;DR
We want to be more transparent with the way we organize events. In this way anyone who attends or coaches at codebar knows our needs and if interested can help us out. The reason why we want to do this is to have more members from the community participate in the organization of events and to help us as we expand.

In this document, you will find
1. The criterion that we use when we prioritize where to host codebar events.
2. A guide for how to contact hosts who want to sponsor a workshop.

# Host prioritization criteria

## Must Have
* **Aligns with the codebar mission**

* **Safe place**

* **Food and drinks**
Learning to code after a long day at work can be hard. Offering free food and giving people the opportunity to take a break and have something to eat before getting started is important.  

We encourage our hosts to provide food and drinks. As our events typically take place immediately after work for many students and coaches, it is recommended that hosts provide some hot food, as attendees will not have another chance to eat dinner.

Food options: try to provide some vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options - everyone will eat vegetarian food but not the other way around so try to keep it 50-50. If you would like recommendations for food, please get in touch with the codebar organizers.

Drinks: Please make sure you provide non-alcoholic drinks and water.
We do prioritize hosts that can provide food and drinks as this makes our events more effective and accessible.

* **Comfortable space for workshops**
The minimum requirements for hosting an event includes providing desk space, power outlets, and a stable internet connection. Ideally the desk space is large enough so that 30 people can comfortably work. If the space is too small, it can make it difficult to hear and concentrate. It is also helpful if the wifi codes are clearly visible, or if they are written on a few pieces of paper so we can share them easily in the group.

At the beginning of each workshop we try to create a relaxed environment so that participants feel welcome and safe. Ideally we would want an open space large enough to have 30 people standing in a circle when we start the round of introductions. If a large open space is not available, other options could work as well (e.g. using a meeting room or a room that is used for trainings).

We do prioritize host that can accommodate a minimum of 30 people.


## Important
* **Accessibility within the city**
As most of our participants are coming from Barcelona, at this time we are only considering hosts within Barcelona.  

* **Maximum capacity**
Event attendee numbers can vary. Ideally we would need a venue that has capacity for a minimum of 30 people.

## Nice to have
* **Comfortable space for talks**
Apart from the regular workshops, we hold one off talks and workshops on specific topics. For these talks we would need space that has a larger conference room with a projector (preferably HDMI and/or with an adapter for Mac Thunderports). Depending on the type of event, we might need just chairs, or if it is an event where participants need to bring laptops, we would also need desk space, power outlets, and a stable internet connection.

## Simplifies organization of workshops
* **Encourages coaches to participate**
We aim to pair each student with a coach. In the event that we do not have enough coaches, we try to pair 2 students that are working on the same tutorial with their assigned coach. Companies that encourage their development team to participate during the workshops help us achieve a better student to coach ratio. This provides a better experience for both students and coaches, as  coaches are better able to guide students, answer their questions, encourage them and help them learn how to tackle problems.

* **Can contact in a short time frame if needed**
We try to book events with our hosts at least a month in advance in order to properly organize an event. Last minute cancellations are not frequent; however, if there is a last minute cancellation, we do prioritize hosts that are open to organizing an event within a short time frame (2 weeks in advance).    

* **Ease of organizing workshops**
Each time that a new host joins codebar, apart from emailing out the [hosting guide] (http://manual.codebar.io/host-guide.html) we try to have one of the codebar organizers meet with the host in order to explain what codebar is, describe how a workshop works, and answer any questions that might arise.

A codebar organizer will always send the host an email with the final head count, a list of attendees, and any other important details one day before the event. As the list of attendees can change up until the last minute, it might not always be 100% accurate. We understand that for security reasons, hosts need a list of people who are attending the event, but we do prioritize hosts that offer some flexibility and allow people to attend if there is enough space.
