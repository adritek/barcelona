# Barcelona chapter processes

The goal of this page is to describe **the way we do things** (our processes) to ease our daily work, the on-boarding of new organizers, and to allow continuos improvement of our chapter in a collaborative way.

# Organizers processes

* [Monthly meetings](org-monthly-meetings/org-monthly-meetings.md): These meetings aim to share the status of the ongoing activities and present new ideas.
* Ad-hoc workshops: These are special (normally one-off) activities to tackle specific topics within the organizers.

# Events processes

* [Setting up an event](workshops-preparation/preparing-a-workshop.md): This guideline provides a step-by-step support for creating an event in codebar.io site and in the local social media resources.
* Event Introduction talk: This is a guideline for the presentation talk in the workshops.
