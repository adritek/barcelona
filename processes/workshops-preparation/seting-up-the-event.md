# Planning an event
Creating a codebar event consists of seven steps which should follow this basic timeline (*details below*)
1. Decide which organizer is responsible for the event.
2. Find a host for the event.
3. Create a card on Trello.
4. Create event on codebar.io, as soon as the host selects a date.
5. Post event on Meetup.com.
6. Communicate with host
7. Complete post-event activities.


### 1. Sign up as event owner
To ensure everyone an equal opportunity to participate at every level of the creation of events it is key that everyone can 'take the lead' of an event. One way of fostering such opportunity is to have each event have an 'owner'. By identifying a single person as the event owner, everyone, regardless of previous experience, temperament, tendencies or personality, etc, will have an equal opportunity to participate.

This does not mean that the 'owner' has to do everything, though they can. Instead they have to check that each activity has been done and if necessary, bring our attention to the fact that things have not yet been completed. This will allow each and every organizer to participate in the process of creating events and communicating with hosts, not simple those who are accustomed to taking the lead.


### 2. Find a host
+ TODO


### 3. Create a card in Trello
Procedures:

Copy [this card](https://trello.com/c/6xVLVl5A) to set up a new workshop:

+ Adjust title to the correct date. Example: "Event 2018.03.08"
+ Set the due date on the card matching the event date
+ Make sure the "Event" blue tag is present
+ Remove the extra logos. Make the correct one the card cover.
+ Define the door responsible and the MC. Assign them as members of the card so they get notification of any changes.
+ Remove everything up to the line below and fill in the rest.

Responsible

Door responsible: [add tag]<br>
MC: ideally the 'owner' becomes the MC [add tag]<br>
Person in charge of pairing [add tag]<br>

### 4. Create an event on codebar.io
The following is for existing hosts only.
 1. Log into to codebar.io
 2. Go to menu and on the left, click the New workshop section.
 3. Select chapter and fill in the form. Choose date, time, host, etc.

At the bottom of the event page there is a checkbox:
* [ ] Invitable

It is enabled as the default. Disable it. We send invitations when the event immediately preceding it has been completed.
As a default, RSVP section automatically opens subscriptions.
That is, students and coaches will be able to sign up for the event. Invitations are not automatically sent out. We wait until the event immediately preceding has ended before we send out invitations.

The morning after an event go back to the event listing on codebar.io, enable invites to the next workshop and send out the invitations. You will be given a choice to invite students, coaches or everybody. Usually we invite everybody. Sometimes we send out second invites for events where we have few people signed up.

Next you will create an event on Meetup.com.


### 5. Create an event on Meetup.com
Go to events on the codebar.io/events and choose the event. Copy the link of the event to add to the meetup event listing. The public link should have this format: https://codebar.io/workshops/XXXX

Go to meetup.com, log in. From your image, go to codebar.
Things to change (in **bold** in the template below):
 1. Change link to specify the event.
 2. Add the name of the host (4th paragraph) with an appropriate message about the host.
 3. Add the webpage of the host.

**Template:**

Details
Are you interested in programming, but you looking for the courage to try it out in a safe and collaborative environment? Have you already started learning, and need some help from other programmers? Are you working on a personal project and don't know how to move forward? Are you thinking of changing your career to something technology related?
Then, this event is the perfect place for you.

IMPORTANT: For this event you will need to register on the codebar page

**https://codebar.io/workshops/XXXX**

We are a non-profit group of students and coaches that love technology and strongly believe that it should be accessible for everyone. For this reason, we run regular free coding meetups for women, members of the LGBTQ community, and other underrepresented groups in tech. Our goal is to enable underrepresented people to learn to program in a safe and collaborative environment and expand their career opportunities.

This time, **insert host here** opens its doors again to host the event. **insert host webpage here**.

Not sure if this event is for you yet? Join our slack channel where you can get in touch with other students and coaches not only from Barcelona but also from other cities where codebar.io has events:

### 6. Communicate with event host
**Attendee checklist.** Before the event we send a list of attendees to the host. You can only access the list of attendees from the codebar webpage if you are logged in as an organizer.  To view the attendees from the go to Menu -> My chapters -> Barcelona

There you can see who has signed up to attend the event as well as sign-up yourself, if you haven't already done so. Please note, if someone registered on the webpage after we sent the invitations they will not appear on the dropdown menu of members who can be added by an organizer.
