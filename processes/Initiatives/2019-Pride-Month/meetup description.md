#WeAreFamilly

Are you part of a LGBTQI+ organization in Tech in Barcelona or do you want to meet them?
We invite you to celebrate pride 🏳️‍🌈 month and meet with other organizations in Tech that have a total or partial LGBTQI+ focus. We want to meet, share , create community and of course celebrate pride month together. 🏳️‍🌈 🎉 🎊
