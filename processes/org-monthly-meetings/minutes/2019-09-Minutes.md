# Ongoing initiatives

## Specific workshops/Curriculum development

**Owner:** @loriking

**Status:**
Having conversations, nothing being definitive. One of the options is to host extra workshops for this, doing it at TW is an option.
Probably for the NOT newcomers.

This topic was merged with: additional workshops

This topic is **ongoing** and should be included in the next meeting.

Try one of them before the end of the year. Try to do it in Hola Luz. Use project board for additional workshops. One-off workshops. (Add the link about the PR) - In all of the initiatives


## Adding collaborators board

**Owner:** @saljuama & @loriking

**Status:**
Reminder: To track people who assist the workshops and are willing to collaborate with Codebar.
The current idea is to document our process, and activities, and then be able to link potential people who can collaborate on this.

No progress - now @jmbriano takes over this initiative

Should we consider this topic before we consider for more organisers?

**Status:**
Check different alternatives and approaches on improve the process. (i.e. have it along with the name tags)
Interesting to collect the information beforehand so maybe we can even share the pairings right after the presentation :o
Do we consider to build a tool? If so, do it in a community way.
What other chapters do?
Do we want to review the workshop presentation too?

This topic is **ongoing** and to be included in the next meeting

-- long-term innitiative: we want to make this a long project (one of the community projects) - PR #36 with different study-backgrounds. take a look at the website and add a button for the pairing tool
