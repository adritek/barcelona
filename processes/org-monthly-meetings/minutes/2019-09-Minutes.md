# Ongoing initiatives

## Specific workshops/Curriculum development

**Owner:** @loriking

**Status:**
Having conversations, nothing being definitive. One of the options is to host extra workshops for this, doing it at TW is an option.
Probably for the NOT newcomers.
We can get feedback from Codebar students about this.
@saljuama, @raquelalvear will join and help @loriking, woho!
This topic was merged with: additional workshops

This topic is **ongoing** and should be included in the next meeting.


## Adding collaborators board

**Owner:** @saljuama & @loriking

**Status:**
Reminder: To track people who assist the workshops and are willing to collaborate with Codebar.
The current idea is to document our process, and activities, and then be able to link potential people who can collaborate on this.

No progress

Should we consider this topic before we consider for more organisers?

This topic is **ongoing** and should be included in the next meeting.

## better pairing support

**Owner:** @jmbriano & @amaliacardenas & @daverick

**Status:**
Check different alternatives and approaches on improve the process. (i.e. have it along with the name tags)
Interesting to collect the information beforehand so maybe we can even share the pairings right after the presentation :o
Do we consider to build a tool? If so, do it in a community way.
What other chapters do?
Do we want to review the workshop presentation too?


## Working with some student on making better the feedback from student to coach

**Owner:**

**Status:**

Possibility to do a PR on improving Codebar page in regards of feedback?


## BCN codebar role in building LGBTQIA + tech community

**Owner:** @daverick

**Status:**

We should push this forward and promote diversity in different companies and other spaces, in a collaborative manner with other organizations already doing this.
There is a Donate button in the codebar page, it is possible to communicate with Codebar the donations that are donated for the barcelona chapter for this purpose.

This topic is **ongoing** and should be included in the next meeting.
