# Monthly meetings

## Objective

As a group we had agreed to be allowed to work on specific initiatives in small groups (which can also include people outside the organizers group). The objective of these regular meetings is to synchronize the progress of the initiatives between the organizers. Also it is the place to present new initiatives and identify other organizers that would like to contribute to it. Last but not least, it's the place to veto initiatives that we consider not aligned with codebar mission or current priorities.

## Attendance

These meetings are part of the responsibilities of being an organizers and should be respected as such. Attendance is important.
**Schedule**: By default, the first Friday of each month. On special circumstances, upon agreement, organizers can decide to move it to another day.
* It is still to be defined the minimum attendance expected from organizers (75% sounds like a fair value, but this has not been discussed yet)

## New Initiatives

When proposing a new initiative to work on, and also when voting for their aproval or rejection, organisers should make sure is aligned with the Codebar mission statement:

> Our goal is to enable underrepresented people to learn programming in a safe and collaborative environment and expand their career opportunities. To achieve this we run free regular workshops, regular one-off events and try to create opportunities for our students making technology and coding more accessible.

## Before a meeting

In order to make good use of everyone's time, people should do their best to: 
* Update the status of the `On Going` initiatives by adding comments in the issues, specially if you can't attend
* [Add new issues](https://github.com/codebar/barcelona/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=initiative-proposal-template.md&title=) for new proposal of initiatives, assign them to someone and link them to the [Initiatives - Monthly Meetings](../projects/2) project
* Add a new proposal for improvement in the trello board  (this is our replacement for retrospectives :yum:)
* Inform the next monthly facilitator if they can't attend

## During the meeting

Given that the meeting last 1 hour (unless attendants agree to extend), the facilitator of the meeting is in charge of leading the meeting so that:
* one item (if any) from the continuous improvement column has been discussed
* every `On Going` initiatives status has been presented and updated
* the initiatives in `New` has been validated (and moved to `Pause` or `On Going`) or rejected 
* check if there is any initiative on `Pause` that wants to be revisited
* a new facilitator has been found for the next monthly meeting
