# Monthly meetings

## Objective

As a group we had agreed to be allowed to work on specific initiatives in small groups (which can also include people outside the organizers group). The objective of these regular meetings is to synchronize the progress of the initiatives between the organizers. Also it is the place to present new initiatives and identify other organizers that would like to contribute to it. Last but not least, it's the place to veto initiatives that we consider not aligned with codebar mission or current priorities.

## Attendance

These meetings are part of the responsibilities of being an organizers and should be respected as such. Attendance is important.
**Schedule**: By default, the first Friday of each month. On special circumstances, upon agreement, organizers can decide to move it to another day.
* It is still to be defined the minimum attendance expected from organizers (75% sounds like a fair value, but this has not been discussed yet)

## New Initiatives

When proposing a new initiative to work on, and also when voting for their aproval or rejection, organisers should make sure is aligned with the Codebar mission statement:

> Our goal is to enable underrepresented people to learn programming in a safe and collaborative environment and expand their career opportunities. To achieve this we run free regular workshops, regular one-off events and try to create opportunities for our students making technology and coding more accessible.

## Before a meeting

In order to make good use of everyone's time, people should do their best to: 
* Update the status of the `on-going` initiatives by adding comments in the issues, specially if you can't attend
* Add new issues or PRs for new proposal of initiatives, assign them to someone and link them to the [Initiatives - Monthly Meetings](../projects/2) project
* Add a new proposal for improvement in the trello board 
* Inform the next monthly facilitator if they can't attend

Additionally, the facilitator should also: 
* At least one week before the meeting, check people's availability for the meeting, if not enough people can make it, then coordinate the rescheduling to another day.
* Check initiative proposals in the `New` column and put them in the column `Next Month Meeting - New` if they have (if they don't ping the organiser who created the issue): 
  * an asignee
  * a description or clear name
  * a checklist of actions

## During the meeting

Given that the meeting liast 1 hour (unless attendants agree to extend), the facilitator of the meeting is in charge of leading the meeting so that:
* an item (if any) from the continuous improvement column has been discussed
* every `on-going` initiatives status has been presented
* the initiatives in `Next Month Meeting - New` has been validated or rejected
* a new facilitator has been found for the next monthly meeting

Process:

1. Continuous Improvement: 
 * From the trello board, check if there are new contiunous improvement items
 * If there are more than one, vote to pick the one to discuss this meeting
 * Discuss the item and then aprove/reject the item, if aproved, define an action item and assign it to someone

2. Review `on-going` Initiatives, for each initiative:
 * Let the owner present the status, or read the last comment in the issue if no owner is present. Initiative status should answer:
  * What are the relevant latests accomplishments for the initiative?
  * What is blocking the initiative to move forward?
  * What are the planned next steps?
 * Decide if the initiative stays in `on-going` or if it is moved to `paused` or `closed`.

3. Validate new initiative proposals in the `Next Month Meeting - New` column, for each new proposal: 
 * Let the owner introduce and explain the proposal
 * Vote the proposal based on if the proposal is aligned with the codebar mission 
  * If aproved and decided to start right away, move to `on-going` and add the interested asignees
  * If aproved but defered, move to `pause`
  * If vetoed, move to `rejected`

4. Review the `pause` column to reevaluate if there is any initiative that can be unpaused and is there anyone who can move it forward.

5. Define the next monthly meeting facilitator, add a comment in the last issue (#68) of the `on-going` column
