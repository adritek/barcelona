# Monthly meetings

## Objective

As a group we had agreed to be allowed to work on specific initiatives in small groups (which can also include people outside the organizers group). The objective of these regular meetings is to synchronize the progress of the initiatives between the organizers. Also it is the place to present new initiatives and identify other organizers that would like to contribute to it. Last but not least, it's the place to veto initiatives that we consider not aligned with codebar mission or current priorities.

## Attendance
These meetings are part of the responsibilities of being an organizers and should be respected as such. Attendance is important.

## Initiatives Tracking

The different initiatives are tracked within the Github Project [Initiatives - Monthly Meetings](../projects/2).
It provides a dynamic dashboard of the different initiatives status and a support for the Monthly Meetings process.

The flow of the initiatives is:
* A new initiative is created by associating to this project an issue or a PR. They will appear directly in the `New` column.
* The monthly meeting facilitator has to move these new initiatives and placed in the column `Next Month Meeting - New`. To be able to be validated and moved there the initiative should have an owner and a description or self explicative name.  
* If accepted during the next meeting they are moved to `on-going` column.
* Unaccepted initiatives are moved to `rejected` column.
* During the monthly meeting an initiative can move to `closed` or `paused` columns.
* The last element #68 in the `on-going` column is a reminder to decided which organizer is the facilitator of the next monthly meeting

**Schedule**: First Friday of each month.


# Meeting preparation

## Meeting preparation by the facilitator
The following bullets describe the preparation that **must happen before** each monthly meeting:
* **Check availability**: At least one week before the meeting, the facilitator should check availability for the upcoming meeting. Organisers that can not attend to the next meeting (neither physically nor remotely) should inform the facilitator as soon as they know they will not be available. In that case, the possibility of having the meeting on a different day could be assessed. An alternative day can be chosen if the attendance would result higher **as long as the participants that could make it in the originally scheduled day can still make it in the new proposed date**. Should there not be any date in the week where the attendance would result higher, then the meeting should take place with the available participants. The facilitator is in charge of coordinating any rescheduling.
    * It is still to be defined the minimum attendance expected from organizers (75% sounds like a fair value, but this has not been discussed yet)
* **Validate new initiatives**: The facilitator validate the initiative in the `New` column and place them in the column `Next Month Meeting - New` if they have a owner and a description or clear name. The facilitator is in charge of getting in touch with the organizer promoting the initiative to nmet the condiction of validation.

## Meeting preparation by the other organizer

A organizer is responsible for:
* adding a  note on the initiative's evolution during the past month as a comment in the corresponding issue or PR. Ideally this note should allow anybody to understand how the initiative status by just reading the associated issue/PR. It will be useful too when an organizer cannot be present at a monthly meeting so that the others know the status.
* add a new issue or PR to the [Initiatives - Monthly Meetings](../projects/2) project when they want to talk about a new initiative in the monthly meeting.

# During the Meeting

The facilitator of the meeting is in charge of leading the meeting so that:
* every `on-going` initiatives status has been presented,
* a new facilitator has been found for the next monthly meeting
* the initiatives in `Next Month Meeting - New` has been validated or rejected
* meeting last 1 hour unless all the attendant agree to make it longer (exceptionally).

Process:
* use the `on-going` column to pass from one initiative status to the others. The facilitator passes the mic to the owner if present, or read the last comment on the initiatives when no owner is present to talk about the initiative's status. an initiative status should answer the following questions:
 * What are the relevant latests accomplishments for the initiative?
 * What is blocking the initiative to move forward?
 * What are the planned next steps?
* assure that only the status of the initiative is discussed and explained. Propose other way of coordination when needed.
* for each initiative it is decided if it stays in `on going`, is move to `paused` or is `closed`.
* When arriving at the last card in the `on-going` column  ()#68) **Define the next facilitator:** This person is in charge of following up the preparation of the meeting and to moderate the meeting itself. The facilitator is defined at the end of the previous meeting and recorded in #68. At the current team size, it's expected that each one is facilitator twice a year.
* Validation process for the  initiatives in `Next Month Meeting - New`. see below
* Review the `pause` column to reevaluate the position of the initiatives there.


## New initiatives acceptation

The second half of the meeting is to present ideas for new initiatives. Before presenting any idea, the idea owner should make sure that it is align with codebar mission statement:

> Our goal is to enable underrepresented people to learn programming in a safe and collaborative environment and expand their career opportunities. To achieve this we run free regular workshops, regular one-off events and try to create opportunities for our students making technology and coding more accessible.

Initiatives can be vetoed during the monthly meeting if any of the present organizers considers that they are not aligned with the mission above.

If the idea is accepted (not vetoed), its implementation is to be planned outside the monthly meetings. Organizers interested in collaborate with the idea should be identified at this stage.

Each initiative must have an owner who will be responsible for updating the rest of the team about the progress in the monthly meetings.

The team can accept an initiative but defer its implementation to a later moment in time. The initiative is then moved to the `pause` column.
