# Barcelona chapter processes

The goal of this page is to describe **the way we do things** to ease our daily work, the on-boarding of new organizers, and to allow continuos improvement of our chapter in a collaborative way.

## Organizers processes

* [Monthly meetings](org-monthly-meetings/org-monthly-meetings.md): These meetings aim to share the status of the ongoing activities and present new ideas.
* [New Organizers onboarding](onboarding-new-organizers/on-boarding-process.md): This is a checklist of actions to complete when a new organizer joins the team. 
* Ad-hoc workshops: These are special (normally one-off) activities to tackle specific topics within the organizers.

## Events processes

* [Setting up an event](workshops-preparation/preparing-a-workshop.md): This guideline provides a step-by-step support for creating an event in codebar.io site and in the local social media resources.
* [Host selection](host-selection/host-prioritization.md): For presential workshops, these are the guidelines to prioritize to which hosts we propose the dates to hold the workshop.
* Event Introduction talk: This is a guideline for the presentation talk in the workshops.

## Other processes

* [Community collaborations](collaborators-board/collaborations.md): When members of the community are interested in collaborating with organizers, this is the list of topics and how they can collaborate.
