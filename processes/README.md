# Barcelona chapter processes

The goal of this page is to describe **the way we do things** to ease our daily work, the on-boarding of new organizers, and to allow continuos improvement of our chapter in a collaborative way.

## Organizers processes

* [Monthly meetings](org-monthly-meetings/org-monthly-meetings.md): These meetings aim to share the status of the ongoing activities and present new ideas.
* [New Organizers onboarding](onboarding-new-organizers/on-boarding-process.md): This is a checklist of actions to complete when a new organizer joins the team.
* Ad-hoc workshops: These are special (normally one-off) activities to tackle specific topics within the organizers.

## Events processes

* [Setting up a virtual workshop](workshops-preparation/preparing-a-virtual-workshop.md): This guideline provides a step-by-step support for creating a virtual workshop on the codebar.io site and on the social media platforms.
* [Host selection](host-selection/host-prioritization.md): For in-person workshops, these are the guidelines we use to prioritize which hosts we propose workshops to.
